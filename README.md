# Books-Wishlist-using-Java-Swing

## **Salient features**

> *Note: There might be some features that I didnâ€™t add to the following list becauseÂ [I forgot them](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5TyYEuvXtXH5Ld4eA)* ðŸ¥²

1. Using this application, Book names can be added, updated, viewed and deleted from the Books Wishlist.
2. Proper architecture has been followed: `JComponents` have been added to the `JPanel`, which in turn goes inside `JInternalFrame`, which finally is contained within a `JFrame`.
3. Appropriate Swing Layout manager (`BoxLayout`) is used for the GUI. 
4. Strict validation checks are in place, keeping in mind all possible edge cases. Robust exceptional handling has been done wherever user input is involved.
    1. For example, preventing the deleting or updating of a book which doesnâ€™t exist in the database.
5. MySQL database was used. 
6. The code is clean, concise and maintainable. The UI is user-friendly. ([Iâ€™m not lying](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9AbEXxEibLLaYtGr9)Â ðŸ¤¥)

## **Screenshots**

Believe it or not, Iâ€™m as eager as you to see the screenshots of my project. When I did this project, during a 6-month internship, I forgot to take screenshots.

In order to generate the screenshots now, Iâ€™ll have to create the database again - which isÂ **very easy**, but time-consuming.

Anyways, at the end of the day, youâ€™d be judging me on myÂ **DSA and low-level design skills**. So what are we waiting for? Kindly contact me onÂ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-salat/)Â and schedule an interview.
